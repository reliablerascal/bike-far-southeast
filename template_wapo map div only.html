<p id="text-PT2Z2MFBUNFONC7YQWCC36JZRM" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn anchor"> For the female pronghorn
    known to researchers as 700031A, the valley in western Wyoming is a paradise in summer. </p>
<p id="text-756STHTEZBCT5BPFY5IBNT6XRE" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn"> The valley surrounds a horseshoe
    lake that curves through the Wind River Range mountains. Sagebrush and mountain flowers, mixed with aspen trees,
    grow on the valley slopes. The vegetation she eats here will help fuel her 150-mile migration south, a journey
    longer than the distance between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. </p>
<p id="text-W62XWKTIFVF7TKA4U7IE4J7FGU" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn"> She leaves in September, before
    winter snow buries edible plants and forms dangerous drifts. </p>
<p id="text-7BDCNMHZ3RG7ZDALDDCOHTKD4A" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn"> 700031A follows a route walked by
    generations of pronghorn. Bones discovered in Wyoming suggest that pronghorn used nearby migration corridors for at
    least 8,000 years, said Greg Nickerson, a writer and filmmaker for the University of Wyoming’s Wyoming Migration
    Initiative. </p>
<p id="text-5UOFXNBK65HBBCZAALGOS55D7M" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn"> The pronghorn lineage in America
    stretches back <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/pronghorn.htm">20 million years</a>. Their ancestors
    endured nearly cataclysmic disasters, such as a Yellowstone supervolcano eruption that blanketed the West in ash
    approximately 640,000 years ago. </p>
<p id="text-BHDYLZTGRFFXVIT7743YRKUEEM" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn"> Researchers placed a GPS collar on
    the 700031A in February 2018 — giving her a number instead of a name, to preserve their scientific detachment. Since
    then, Sawyer, who studies migration patterns, has monitored her movements on his computer. </p>
<p id="text-26OTDQ2KBJE5XGEMBABOIZKHI4" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn anchor"> As the pronghorn heads south
    to a milder winter habitat, she nears Highway 191, where tall fences corral her to a crossing site. She walks across
    an overpass named <a href="http://www.trapperspoint.com/">Trappers Point</a>, a gentle hump of bridge designed for
    animals and completed in 2012. </p>
<p id="text-BXDTIAXSXJBEFD53YZ27LY24YQ" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn"> “We know that pronghorn and mule
    deer have been using that overpass,” said University of Wyoming graduate student Benjamin Robb, who watched
    700031A’s movements on a computer screen in his Laramie office. “But seeing a collared animal using it is really
    cool.” </p>
<p id="text-OUSXGEI5WRFXRBCWOXBBUBYYCA" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn anchor"> 700031A skirts to the west of
    two gas fields. “She’s actually avoiding all the infrastructure,” said Sawyer, who estimates the pronghorn is an
    adult between 6 and 8 years old. She moves swiftly, traveling several miles a day, until she reaches the Green
    River. The water level drops in the fall, so she probably wades across, he said. </p>
<p id="text-NZSQIIE6VJHWRIQBMEHPU2VSCM" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn anchor"> The coffee-colored pronghorn,
    following a narrow band of sagebrush, crosses two more highways. She navigates these roads without using wildlife
    bridges. She walks along the edge of the fenced-off solar farm “smack dab in the middle” of the corridor, Robb said.
</p>
<p id="text-7BDCNMHZ3RG7ZDALDDCOHTKD4A" class="pg-body-copy scroll-step-pronghorn anchor"> By early November, 700031A
    arrived near Wyoming’s southern lip. Here, this descendant of supervolcano survivors encountered a new kind of
    obstacle: Interstate 80. The superhighway stopped her in her tracks. </p>
